SDF
===

SDF is a Common Lisp port of the [msdfgen fork](https://github.com/ckohnert/msdfgen) by ckohnert, 
originally forked from [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) by Viktor Chlumsky.

It is currently under development and not ready for use. In its current
state, it is a crude translation which will require refactoring/lispfying
once basic functionality is achieved.

For more details on the thesis/algorithm, see msdfgen README/documentation.

## TODO
* Implement other sdf generation functions (focus is on the msdf method).
* Check floating-point precision.
* Test various fonts and use cases.
* Implement console program and command-line options?
