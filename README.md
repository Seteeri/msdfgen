SDF
===


SDF is a Common Lisp port of the [msdfgen fork](https://github.com/ckohnert/msdfgen) by ckohnert, 
originally from [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) by Viktor Chlumsky.

It is currently under development and not ready for use. In its current
state, it is a crude translation which will require refactoring/lispfying
once basic functionality is achieved.

For more details on the algorithm, see msdfgen README/documentation.

## TODO
* Finish implementing other edge-segment functions.
* Implement other sdf functions (focus is on the msdf method).
* Check floating-point precision.
* Test various fonts and use cases.
* Implement console program and command-line options.
